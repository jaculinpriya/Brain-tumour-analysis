# Brain-tumour-analysis
Developed a deep learning-based solution for classifying brain MRI images into multiple categories according to tumor type. It involves building a custom CNN model from scratch and enhancing performance through transfer learning using pretrained models. Deployed in Stream lit to enable real-time tumor type predictions from uploaded MRI images.
